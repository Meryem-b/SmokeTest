  #Scenario: CSCO reclaiming a users account
    #Given I am logged in as a CSCO user
    #And I search for a user
    #And I reclaim their account

    #And I login as the reclaim user using the temporary password
    #And I enter a valid password
    #And I enter a valid security question / answers

    #And I confirm the details are as expected
    #And I logout as the reclaimed user
    #And I login as the reclaimed user
