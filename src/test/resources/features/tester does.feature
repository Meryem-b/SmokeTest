# Theme 1 (Standard Regression), Test 7:
# Tester does:
#   MOT test
#   Retest
#   Abort
#   Add RFR Failures to a FAIL
#   Add PRS Failures to a PASS
#   Add advisory tests to both FAIL and PASS
#   Add, Edit, Remove a defect.
#
# When I do this, I usually log a vehicle and fail it. I then log it for retest and abort it. I then log it for retest
# again and fail it again. Finally I log the vehicle, ensuring that it canâ€™t be logged as a retest and pass it. For
# each I will add  advisory items (usually 2 or 3) and ensure that I can edit and remove them before completing the
# test. I will also do a PRS on the passed test. The failure / PRS / advisory items are different each time, but not
# the end of the world if the same ones are used in each test.
#
# vary if tester aborts, fellow tester at same site aborts
